# PythonMicroservices

## Instructions to Run the Microservices
The code contains 3 microservices - userService, contentService, UserInteractionService.</br>
To run the 3 microservices, download the repository, navigate to the downloaded repository and run teh following command in terminal:</br>
**`./start`**</br>
This command will start all the docker containers, set up the db and run all the microservices. If the program appears to be stuck, wait for progress. It might take some a minute or so for the docker-containers to build the first time.
